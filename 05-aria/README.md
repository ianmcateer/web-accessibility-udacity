## Introd

so far 
- sensible dom order
- logicial focus startegy
- using native elements gives us built in semantics
- labelling controls and images, using headings 
- importance of links 

but sometimes doesnt take us far enough

no standardized html for a dropdown menu

## WHy ARIA

http://udacity.github.io/ud891/lesson5-semantics-aria/02-why-aria/index.html

strongly encourage using native elements becuase they give you focus, keyboard support and built in semnaitcs for free

but there are instances where antive html wont cut it 

WAI-ARIA

alows specify attributes on elements ehich modify the way that element is translated into the accessibility tree

example

a checkbox - if create it using a div - need to use aria to tell screen reader the extra information
